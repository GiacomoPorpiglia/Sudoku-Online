# Sudoku online
Hey there! This project is a MERN stack website where you can play Sudoku! <br/>
The grids are backend-generated by a simple backtracking algorithm. Also don't worry, the solution is guaranteed to be unique! <br />
The website is responsive, so you can play on it from different devices without any worries! <br />
There are four difficulty settings (Easy, Medium, Hard and Extreme), so everyone can play having fun based on his skill level. <br />
I will soon put the website online! <br />
Have fun!

## To do
Remake the sudoku generation algorithm (I made it 2 years ago, and it's probably garbage).
